Notes about setting up and using Rayhunter

## What I read

## What I did
- Bought Orbic RC400L from [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=Orbic+RC400L).  Cost $15, that inlcuded shipping and it had a charging cord and sim card installed.  It was an eBay refurshed item.  The sim card isn't "live".  When the device starts up is says no service found.
- I was working with [Mint Linux](https://www.linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=319), which I had installed on an old laptop.  I didn't need to try and set up dual booting, so the install was fairly easy.
- Download the file to install
- Move to download folder
- Expanded with `$> tar -xvf release.tar`
- Changed to superuser `$> sudo -i`
- Install it `$> ./install.sh`

### Notes still to add above
- What I ordered, how much it cost, what it same with
- I see one to three file captures per day
- There is no tracking of where I am, so if I moving around and don't look a the device I might not know where exact I got the hit?
- Steps to the software (same with sim card)
- How to start the server (need to be root)
- Mattermost
