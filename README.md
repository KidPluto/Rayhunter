Notes about setting up and using Rayhunter

## What I read

## What I did
- Bought xxx from eBay.  Cost $15, that inlcuded shipping and it had a charging cord and sim card installed.  It was an eBay refurshed item.
- I was working with [Mint Linux](https://www.linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=319), which I had installed on an old laptop.  I didn't need to try and set up dual booting, so the install was fairly easy. 

### To add
What I ordered, how much it cost, what it same with

Mint Linux
Steps to the software (same with sim card)
How to start the server (need to be root)
